  □ Back relaxed
  □ Back flexed
  □ Optional: Specific muscle group focus based on goals

Camera Setup:
  □ Use a tripod or stable surface
  □ Same distance from camera each time
  □ Same height/angle
  □ Timer function to avoid holding phone

Photo Tracking:
  □ Create a dedicated album
  □ Label with date and body weight

| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | |

Performance Test Protocols:

Push Strength:
- Bench Press: 3RM test
- Record weight × reps × 1.0333 for estimated 1RM

Pull Strength:
- Bent Over Row: 5RM test
- Record weight × reps × 1.1307 for estimated 1RM

Leg Strength:
- Squat: 3RM test
- Record weight × reps × 1.0333 for estimated 1RM

Work Capacity:
- 100-rep challenge: Select push, pull, and leg exercise
- Record time to complete 100 total reps (alternating exercises)
- Weight used should be approximately 60% of 10RM

Recovery:
- Heart Rate Recovery test:
  1. 2-minute high-intensity work (burpees, jump rope, etc.)
  2. Record heart rate immediately after
  3. Rest 60 seconds
  4. Record heart rate again
  5. Calculate difference (larger difference = better recovery)
