# Nutrition for Hypertrophy

Optimal nutrition is essential for maximizing muscle growth. This guide provides evidence-based recommendations to support the APEX hypertrophy program.

## Caloric Requirements

To build muscle effectively, you need to consume more calories than you burn—a caloric surplus. However, the surplus should be moderate to minimize excessive fat gain.

### Calculating Your Needs

1. **Step 1: Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**

   For men:
   BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(y) + 5

   For women:
   BMR = 10 × weight(kg) + 6.25 × height(cm) - 5 × age(y) - 161

2. **Step 2: Apply Activity Multiplier**

   - Sedentary (office job, minimal exercise): BMR × 1.2
   - Lightly active (light exercise 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375
   - Moderately active (moderate exercise 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55
   - Very active (intense exercise 6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725
   - Extremely active (very intense exercise, physical job): BMR × 1.9

3. **Step 3: Add Hypertrophy Surplus**

   - Beginner lifters: Add 350-500 calories
   - Intermediate lifters: Add 250-350 calories
   - Advanced lifters: Add 200-250 calories

### Monitoring and Adjusting

- Track your weight 2-3 times per week in the morning (after using the bathroom, before eating)
- Calculate weekly averages to assess trends
- Aim for weight gain of 0.25-0.5% of body weight per week (0.5-1 pound for a 200lb individual)
- If gaining too quickly, reduce calories by 10%
- If not gaining, increase calories by 10%

## Macronutrient Distribution

### Protein: The Foundation for Growth

- **Recommended intake**: 1.8-2.2g per kg of bodyweight (0.8-1g per pound)
- **Optimal distribution**: 4-6 meals with 25-40g protein per meal
- **Protein quality**: Focus on complete proteins with high leucine content
- **Best sources**: Whey protein, eggs, chicken, lean beef, fish, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese

### Carbohydrates: Fuel for Performance

- **Recommended intake**: 4-7g per kg of bodyweight (higher on training days)
- **Training day carbs**: 5-7g/kg
- **Rest day carbs**: 3-5g/kg
- **Carb timing**: Higher around workouts, lower further from workouts
- **Best sources**: Rice, potatoes, oats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains

### Fats: Hormonal Support

- **Recommended intake**: 0.8-1.2g per kg of bodyweight
- **Essential fats**: Ensure adequate omega-3 intake (2-3g EPA/DHA daily)
- **Best sources**: Olive oil, nuts, avocados, fatty fish, egg yolks, grass-fed butter

## Meal Timing and Frequency

### Optimal Frequency

- **Protein feeding**: Every 3-5 hours (typically 4-6 meals per day)
- **Total daily meals**: 4-6 evenly spaced meals optimize muscle protein synthesis
- **Pre-sleep nutrition**: Slow-digesting protein (casein) can reduce overnight muscle breakdown

### Nutrient Timing

- **Pre-workout**: 1-2 hours before training
  - 25-40g protein
  - 40-60g carbohydrates
  - Low fat (5-10g)

- **Intra-workout**: During training
  - 5-10g EAAs or 20-30g whey isolate
  - 20-30g fast-digesting carbs for sessions over 60 minutes
  - Electrolytes for optimal hydration

- **Post-workout**: Within 30-45 minutes after training
  - 30-40g fast-digesting protein
  - 60-80g high-glycemic carbohydrates
  - Minimal fat (delays nutrient absorption)
