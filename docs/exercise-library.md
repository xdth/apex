## Chest Exercises

### Bench Press

**Equipment**: Barbell

**Category**: Compound, Push

**Primary Muscles**: Chest
**Secondary Muscles**: Shoulders, Triceps

**Execution**:
1. Lie flat on a bench with feet firmly on the ground
2. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder width
3. Unrack the bar and lower it with control to mid-chest
4. Press the bar back up to full arm extension
5. Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions

**Form Cues**:
- Maintain a natural arch in the lower back
- Keep shoulder blades retracted and depressed
- Lower the bar with control (2-second eccentric)
- Bar path should form a slight diagonal line from shoulders to mid-chest
- Drive through the feet to create a stable base

**Common Errors**:
- Bouncing the bar off the chest
- Excessive arch in the lower back
- Flaring the elbows too wide
- Inconsistent bar path
- Lifting hips off the bench

**Hypertrophy Tips**:
- For maximum chest activation, focus on squeezing the pecs at the top
- Vary grip width occasionally to target different parts of the chest
- Pause briefly at the bottom to eliminate momentum and increase tension
- Consider 1.5 reps (full rep + half rep) to increase time under tension
- Perform occasional sets with higher reps (12-15) for metabolic stress

### Dumbbell Flyes

**Equipment**: Dumbbells

**Category**: Isolation, Push

**Primary Muscles**: Chest
**Secondary Muscles**: Shoulders

**Execution**:
1. Lie on a flat bench holding dumbbells above chest, palms facing each other
2. Maintain a slight bend in the elbows
3. Lower dumbbells in an arc motion until you feel a stretch in the chest
4. Return to starting position by squeezing chest muscles
5. Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions

**Form Cues**:
- Maintain a slight bend in the elbows throughout the movement
- Focus on the stretch at the bottom position
- Visualize hugging a barrel during the concentric phase
- Keep shoulder blades retracted and stable
- Control the weights throughout the entire range of motion

**Common Errors**:
- Straightening the arms completely (puts stress on elbow joints)
- Using momentum to swing the weights
- Allowing shoulders to roll forward
- Insufficient range of motion
- Turning the movement into a press

**Hypertrophy Tips**:
- Focus on the stretched position at the bottom for 1-2 seconds
- Squeeze chest muscles forcefully at the top
- Use a controlled tempo (3:1:2 works well)
- Can be used as a pre-exhaust before pressing movements
- Lighter weight with proper form is more effective than heavy weight with poor form

## Back Exercises

### Deadlifts

**Equipment**: Barbell

**Category**: Compound, Pull

**Primary Muscles**: Lower Back
**Secondary Muscles**: Calves, Forearms, Glutes, Hamstrings, Middle Back, Quads, Traps

**Execution**:
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, barbell over mid-foot
2. Bend at the hips and knees to grip the bar just outside the legs
3. Lower hips, lift chest, and flatten back
4. Drive through the heels, keeping the bar close to the body
5. Stand tall, push hips forward at the top
6. Return the weight to the floor with control

**Form Cues**:
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement
- Drive through the heels and push the floor away
- Keep the bar close to the body throughout the lift
- Engage the lats to keep the bar path vertical
- Fully lock out at the top by squeezing glutes

**Common Errors**:
- Rounding the lower back
- Starting with hips too high
- Letting the bar drift away from the body
- Looking up excessively
- Jerking the weight off the floor

**Hypertrophy Tips**:
- Control the eccentric (lowering) phase for additional muscle stimulus
- Focus on feeling the target muscles rather than just moving weight
- Consider using straps for higher rep sets to prevent grip failure
- Vary stance width occasionally to emphasize different muscles
- For back development, ensure proper lat engagement throughout
