# APEX Workout Program

The APEX program follows a 6-day Push/Pull/Legs split performed twice weekly. This structure optimizes training frequency, volume, and recovery for maximum hypertrophy.

## Training Split Overview

- **Day 1: Push A** - Chest-focused with shoulder and triceps work
- **Day 2: Pull A** - Back-focused with biceps and trapezius work
- **Day 3: Legs A** - Quad-focused with complete lower body development
- **Day 4: Push B** - Shoulder-focused with chest and triceps work
- **Day 5: Pull B** - Lat-focused with biceps and rear deltoid work
- **Day 6: Legs B** - Hamstring and glute-focused with complete lower body development
- **Day 7: Rest** - Active recovery and complete rest

## Exercise Selection Principles

The APEX program follows specific exercise selection principles to maximize hypertrophy:

1. **Compound First (Usually)**: Most workouts begin with compound movements to target multiple muscle groups when energy is highest
2. **Pre-exhaustion Exception**: Some workouts use pre-exhaustion, starting with isolation exercises to enhance mind-muscle connection
3. **Exercise Variety**: Each muscle group is targeted with multiple exercises from different angles
4. **Strategic Sequencing**: Exercises are ordered to maximize fatigue in target muscles while minimizing fatigue in supporting muscles
5. **Equipment Optimization**: Exercise selection is optimized for the available equipment (barbell, dumbbells, EZ bar, incline bench)

## Workout Structure

Each workout follows this general structure:

1. **Warm-up**: 5-10 minutes general warm-up plus specific activation for target muscles
2. **Main Working Sets**: 4-7 exercises targeting primary and secondary muscle groups
3. **Advanced Techniques**: Strategic implementation of specialized hypertrophy techniques
4. **Cool-down**: Brief stretching for worked muscle groups (optional)

## Advanced Training Techniques

The APEX program incorporates various advanced techniques to maximize hypertrophy stimulus:

- [Mechanical Drop Sets](/apex/docs/techniques/mechanical-drop-sets/)
- [Double Rest-Pause Method](/apex/docs/techniques/rest-pause/)
- [Tempo Manipulation](/apex/docs/techniques/tempo-training/)
- [Pre-Exhaustion](/apex/docs/techniques/pre-exhaustion/)
- [Partial Reps](/apex/docs/techniques/partial-reps/)

See the [Advanced Techniques Guide](/apex/docs/techniques/) for complete implementation details.
