## Exercise Descriptions

### Dumbbell Squat

**Target Muscles**: Quads (primary), Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides
2. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
3. Keeping your chest up and back straight, bend at the knees and hips
4. Lower your body until thighs are parallel to the ground or slightly below
5. Push through your heels to return to the starting position
6. Maintain a controlled tempo throughout the movement

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep your chest up and spine neutral throughout
- Track knees in line with toes
- Distribute weight evenly through the foot, with emphasis on heels
- Maintain tension throughout the movement
- Achieve proper depth (at least parallel)

**Common Errors**:
- Rounding the lower back
- Allowing knees to cave inward
- Rising onto toes during the descent
- Insufficient depth
- Looking down instead of forward/slightly up

### Barbell Squats

**Target Muscles**: Quads (primary), Calves, Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Position the barbell on your upper traps/rear delts (high bar) or lower on rear delts (low bar)
2. Unrack the bar and step back, feet shoulder-width or slightly wider
3. Brace your core and maintain a neutral spine
4. Descend by bending at the knees and hips simultaneously
5. Lower until thighs are parallel to the floor or slightly below
6. Drive through your heels to stand back up
7. For the double rest-pause on last set: After reaching failure, rest 15 seconds, continue to failure again, rest 15 seconds, then final push to failure

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement
- Create full-body tension before initiating the descent
- Keep a stable, balanced foot position
- Brace the core throughout the movement
- Drive the knees out during the ascent

**Common Errors**:
- Good morning posture (excessive forward lean)
- Heel elevation during descent
- Incomplete depth
- Knee valgus (collapse inward)
- Losing upper back tightness

### Lunges

**Target Muscles**: Quads (primary), Glutes, Hamstrings (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides
2. Stand with feet hip-width apart
3. Take a controlled step forward with one leg
4. Lower your body until both knees are bent at approximately 90 degrees
5. Front knee should be directly above or slightly behind your ankle
6. Push through the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position
7. Alternate legs with minimal rest between sides

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain an upright posture throughout
- Control the descent to protect the knees
- Keep the front knee tracking in line with the foot
- Step far enough forward to allow for proper form
- Maintain core stability throughout

**Common Errors**:
- Leaning too far forward
- Allowing the front knee to extend beyond the toes
- Taking too short or too long of a stride
- Dropping the back knee too hard
- Using momentum rather than controlled movement

### Stiff-Leg Deadlifts

**Target Muscles**: Hamstrings (primary), Glutes, Lower Back (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Hold a barbell with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart
2. Stand with feet hip-width apart
3. Keep a slight bend in your knees throughout the movement
4. Maintaining a flat back, hinge at the hips and lower the bar
5. Lower the bar toward the top of your feet, feeling a stretch in your hamstrings
6. Stop when you feel a significant stretch, typically when the bar reaches mid-shin
7. Drive your hips forward to return to the standing position
8. Use a controlled 3-second eccentric (lowering) phase

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout
- Focus on the hip hinge movement pattern
- Keep the bar close to the body throughout
- Feel a deep stretch in the hamstrings at the bottom
- Fully extend the hips at the top position

**Common Errors**:
- Rounding the lower back
- Bending the knees too much (turning into a conventional deadlift)
- Starting with the bar too far from the body
- Not hinging properly at the hips
- Insufficient hamstring stretch

### Standing One-Leg Calf Raise

**Target Muscles**: Calves (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Hold a dumbbell in one hand for balance
2. Stand on one foot, with the ball of your foot on a raised surface or the floor
3. Lower your heel toward the ground until you feel a stretch in your calf
4. Pause for 1 second at the bottom of the movement
5. Push through the ball of your foot to raise your heel as high as possible
6. Squeeze your calf at the top of the movement
7. Complete all reps on one leg before switching to the other

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain balance throughout the movement
- Achieve a full range of motion (deep stretch to full contraction)
- Focus on the 1-second pause at the bottom position
- Use an explosive but controlled concentric phase
- Keep the knee slightly bent but stable

**Common Errors**:
- Insufficient range of motion
- Skipping the pause at the bottom
- Letting the ankle roll inward or outward
- Using momentum instead of calf strength
- Rushing through repetitions

### Weighted Sit-Ups

**Target Muscles**: Abs (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor
2. Hold a dumbbell on your chest or behind your head
3. Contract your abs to curl your upper body off the floor
4. Continue rising until your torso is upright
5. Slowly lower back to the starting position with control
6. For the mechanical drop set (last set only): After reaching failure with the weight, immediately continue with bodyweight sit-ups to failure

**Key Technical Points**:
- Focus on using the abdominals, not hip flexors
- Maintain a controlled tempo throughout
- Keep the neck in a neutral position
- Exhale during the concentric (upward) phase
- Maintain tension in the abs throughout the movement

**Common Errors**:
- Pulling on the neck
- Using momentum to swing up
- Lifting the feet off the ground
- Rising with hip flexors rather than abdominals
- Incomplete range of motion

### Plank With Feet On Bench

**Target Muscles**: Abs (primary), Lower Back (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Assume a forearm plank position with forearms on the floor
2. Place your feet on a bench, elevating your body
3. Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels
4. Keep your core tight and don't allow your hips to sag
5. Hold the position for 30-60 seconds
6. For progressive overload, place a small weight plate on your lower back (advanced)

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout
- Engage the core by drawing the navel toward the spine
- Keep the shoulders stacked directly above the elbows
- Squeeze the glutes to help maintain proper alignment
- Breathe steadily throughout the hold

**Common Errors**:
- Allowing the hips to sag
- Raising the hips too high (pike position)
- Shifting weight too far forward or backward
- Holding the breath
- Excessive shoulder elevation (shrugging)

## Advanced Techniques Used

### Pre-Exhaustion

Applied to Dumbbell Squats performed before Barbell Squats. This technique involves performing an isolation or lighter compound movement before a heavier compound exercise that targets the same muscle group. By pre-fatiguing the muscles, you ensure greater muscle fiber recruitment during the subsequent heavier movement, which can lead to enhanced hypertrophy stimulus.

### Double Rest-Pause

Applied to the last set of Barbell Squats. After reaching initial failure, rest for 15 seconds, then continue to failure again. Rest another 15 seconds, then complete a final push to failure. This technique allows you to extend a set beyond initial failure, accumulating more volume and stimulating more growth than a conventional straight set.

### Eccentric Emphasis

Applied to Stiff-Leg Deadlifts. Using a slower eccentric (lowering) phase of 3 seconds increases time under tension and enhances muscle damage, a key stimulus for hypertrophy. This technique is particularly effective for hamstring development, which responds well to controlled eccentric loading.

### Mechanical Drop Set

Applied to the last set of Weighted Sit-Ups. After reaching failure with the weighted sit-ups, immediately continue with bodyweight sit-ups. This technique changes the mechanical leverage to allow continued work after reaching failure with the more challenging variation, extending the set and creating additional metabolic stress.

### Peak Contraction with Explosive Concentric

Applied to Standing One-Leg Calf Raises. By pausing at the stretched position and then executing an explosive contraction, you maximize both the stretch-mediated hypertrophy stimulus and the recruitment of high-threshold motor units, which can lead to greater muscle development over time.

## Workout Progression

- **Week 1-2**: Focus on mastering proper form and achieving full range of motion on all exercises. Use weights that allow you to reach the higher end of the rep ranges.

- **Week 3-4**: Increase weights by 5-10% on compound movements and 2.5-5% on isolation exercises. Begin fully implementing the double rest-pause technique on barbell squats and extend the mechanical drop set on weighted sit-ups.

- **Week 5-6**: Further increase weights to reach the lower end of the rep ranges while maintaining perfect form. Consider adding more weight to the progressive overload plank if recovery allows.

## Nutrition Considerations

- **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before)**:
  - 30-40g protein (whey isolate or lean animal source)
  - 50-70g complex carbohydrates (oats, rice, potatoes)
  - 5-10g healthy fats
  - 200-300mg caffeine (if tolerated), 30-45 minutes pre-workout

- **Intra-Workout**:
  - 5-10g EAAs or 20-30g whey isolate
  - 20-40g fast-digesting carbs (highly branched cyclic dextrin or dextrose)
  - Electrolytes for optimal hydration

- **Post-Workout (within 30-45 minutes)**:
  - 35-45g fast-digesting protein (whey isolate)
  - 70-90g high-glycemic carbohydrates
  - Consider adding 5g creatine monohydrate

## Recovery Notes

- This is a high-demand leg workout; ensure 72+ hours before training legs directly again
- Focus on proper sleep (7-9 hours) to maximize recovery and growth hormone release
- Implement self-myofascial release (foam rolling) for quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves
- Consider contrast therapy (alternating hot and cold) or Epsom salt baths for significant muscle soreness
- Increase water intake to 3-4 liters on this training day
- Consider gentle active recovery (walking, light cycling) the following day to increase blood flow and reduce soreness
