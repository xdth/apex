## Exercise Descriptions

### Incline Dumbbell Fly

**Target Muscles**: Chest (primary), Shoulders (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Set an adjustable bench to 30-45 degrees incline
2. Lie back on the bench with a dumbbell in each hand
3. Begin with arms extended above the chest, palms facing each other, slight bend in elbows
4. Lower the dumbbells in a wide arc until you feel a stretch in your chest
5. Maintain the bend in your elbows throughout the movement
6. Squeeze your chest to bring the dumbbells back up in the same arc motion
7. Focus on feeling the stretch and contraction in the upper chest

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain a slight bend in the elbows throughout (do not straighten arms completely)
- Focus on moving arms in a hugging motion
- Keep shoulder blades retracted and stable on the bench
- Control the eccentric (lowering) portion
- Feel the stretch at the bottom position

**Common Errors**:
- Straightening the arms completely (turning it into a press)
- Excessive elbow bend (turning it into a press)
- Using momentum instead of controlled movement
- Allowing elbows to drop below shoulder level
- Inadequate range of motion

### Incline Bench Press

**Target Muscles**: Chest (primary), Shoulders, Triceps (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Set bench to 30-45 degrees incline
2. Lie on the bench with feet flat on the floor
3. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder width
4. Unrack the bar and lower it with control to the upper chest
5. Press the bar back up to full extension, focusing on the upper chest
6. Maintain a consistent bar path throughout all repetitions
7. Use a controlled tempo with emphasis on the eccentric phase

**Key Technical Points**:
- Retract and depress the scapulae (pull shoulders back and down)
- Maintain a slight arch in the lower back
- Keep elbows at approximately 45-60 degrees to the torso
- Drive through the mid-foot for stability
- Focus on the upper chest contraction during the press

**Common Errors**:
- Excessive arch in the lower back
- Flaring the elbows too wide
- Bouncing the bar off the chest
- Inconsistent bar path
- Lifting hips off the bench during the press

### Dumbbell Floor Press

**Target Muscles**: Triceps (primary), Chest, Shoulders (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Lie on the floor with knees bent and feet flat
2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder level
3. Press the dumbbells up until arms are fully extended
4. Lower the weights until your upper arms touch the floor
5. Pause briefly when arms touch the floor
6. Press back up to the starting position
7. For the partial reps (last set): After reaching failure, perform 4-6 partial repetitions in the top half of the range of motion

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep wrists straight and elbows tucked at about 45 degrees
- Touch the floor with triceps/elbows, not the dumbbells
- Focus on triceps contraction at the top of the movement
- Maintain full-body tension throughout
- Control the dumbbells throughout the movement

**Common Errors**:
- Flaring elbows too wide
- Bouncing elbows off the floor
- Arching the back excessively
- Using momentum rather than controlled movement

### Arnold Press

**Target Muscles**: Shoulders (primary), Triceps (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Sit on a bench with back support or stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Hold dumbbells at shoulder height, palms facing your body
3. Begin pressing up while simultaneously rotating your palms to face forward
4. Continue pressing until arms are fully extended overhead
5. Reverse the movement, rotating palms back toward your body as you lower
6. Return to the starting position with controlled 3-second eccentric phase
7. Focus on the rotational component throughout the movement

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain an upright torso throughout
- Rotate the palms smoothly during the press
- Control the weight through the full range of motion
- Keep core engaged for stability
- Focus on the 3-second eccentric lowering phase

**Common Errors**:
- Leaning back excessively during the press
- Incomplete rotation of the palms
- Rushing through the eccentric phase

### Bent Over Dumbbell Reverse Fly

**Target Muscles**: Shoulders (posterior deltoid) (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent
2. Hinge at the hips until torso is nearly parallel to the floor
3. Hold dumbbells with palms facing each other or toward the floor
4. Maintaining a slight bend in the elbows, raise arms out to the sides
5. Lift until arms are approximately parallel to the floor
6. Squeeze the rear delts at the top for 2 seconds
7. Lower the weights back to the starting position with control

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep the spine neutral throughout
- Maintain the hinge position at the hips
- Focus on using the rear delts, not the traps
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows throughout
- Perform the 2-second squeeze at the contracted position

**Common Errors**:
- Rounding the back

- Insufficient pause at the top of the movement

### French Press

**Target Muscles**: Triceps (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Sit on a bench with back support or stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Hold an EZ bar with a narrow grip overhead, arms fully extended
3. Keep upper arms stationary, pointing straight up
4. Lower the bar behind your head by bending at the elbows
5. Lower until you feel a deep stretch in the triceps
6. Extend arms to return to the starting position
7. For double rest-pause (last set only): After reaching failure, rest 15 seconds, continue to failure again, rest 15 seconds, final push to failure

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep upper arms vertical and stationary throughout
- Focus on triceps contraction during extension
- Maintain a slight forward lean to allow full range of motion
- Control the weight during the eccentric phase
- Keep elbows tucked in (not flaring outward)

**Common Errors**:
- Moving the upper arms instead of keeping them stationary
- Using momentum to lift the weight
- Insufficient range of motion
- Flaring the elbows outward
- Arching the back excessively

### Front Raises

**Target Muscles**: Shoulders (anterior deltoid) (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Hold dumbbells in front of your thighs, palms facing your body
3. Keeping arms straight (slight bend in elbows), raise one dumbbell in front of you
4. Lift until arm is parallel to the floor
5. Lower with control and repeat with the opposite arm
6. Alternate arms with minimal rest between reps
7. Maintain controlled breathing throughout

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows to reduce joint stress
- Raise to shoulder height (not higher)
- Control the movement throughout the range of motion
- Maintain a stable torso throughout
- Focus on the anterior deltoid engagement

**Common Errors**:
- Using momentum to swing the weights

- Raising dumbbells too high (above shoulder level)
- Shrugging the shoulders during the movement
- Locking the elbows completely

## Advanced Techniques Used

### Pre-Exhaustion

Applied to Incline Dumbbell Fly performed before Incline Bench Press. This technique involves performing an isolation movement before a compound exercise that targets the same muscle group. By pre-fatiguing the upper chest with flyes, you enhance the mind-muscle connection and ensure greater muscle fiber recruitment during the subsequent heavier incline press, leading to enhanced hypertrophy stimulus.

### Reduced Rest Periods

Applied to Incline Bench Press. Using shorter rest periods (90 seconds instead of the typical 2-3 minutes for compound movements) increases metabolic stress and growth hormone production. This technique creates a more favorable hormone environment for muscle growth while maintaining sufficient recovery to preserve performance on subsequent sets.

### Partial Repetitions

Applied to the last set of Dumbbell Floor Press. After reaching failure with full-range repetitions, continuing with 4-6 partial reps in the top range of motion extends the set beyond initial failure. This technique allows you to target the triceps at their strongest angle, recruiting additional muscle fibers that weren't completely fatigued during the full-range repetitions.

### Tempo Manipulation

Applied to Arnold Press with a 3-second eccentric phase. By slowing down the lowering portion of the exercise, you increase time under tension, which is a primary driver of hypertrophy. The extended eccentric phase also enhances microdamage to the muscle fibers, stimulating greater repair and growth response.

### Peak Contraction

Applied to Bent Over Dumbbell Reverse Fly with a 2-second hold at the top position. This technique maximizes tension in the shortened position of the muscle, enhancing the mind-muscle connection and ensuring complete activation of the posterior deltoids. The isometric hold also increases time under tension for greater hypertrophy stimulus.

### Double Rest-Pause

Applied to the last set of French Press. After reaching initial failure, rest for 15 seconds, then continue to failure again. Rest another 15 seconds, then complete a final push to failure. This technique allows you to extend a set beyond initial failure, accumulating more volume and stimulating more growth than a conventional straight set.

### Alternating Limb Work

Applied to Front Raises. By alternating between arms with minimal rest, you can maintain continuous tension on the target muscles while allowing each individual side brief recovery between repetitions. This technique allows for greater total volume and creates additional metabolic stress for enhanced hypertrophy.

## Workout Progression

- **Week 1-2**: Focus on mastering proper form and achieving full range of motion on all exercises. Use weights that allow you to reach the higher end of the rep ranges.

- **Week 3-4**: Increase weights by 5-10% on compound movements and 2.5-5% on isolation exercises. Begin fully implementing the partial rep and double rest-pause techniques. Increase the duration of peak contractions on reverse flyes.

- **Week 5-6**: Further increase weights to reach the lower end of the rep ranges while maintaining perfect form. Consider adding more volume to the pre-exhaustion phase by adding an additional set of incline flyes if recovery allows.

## Nutrition Considerations

- **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before)**:
  - 25-40g protein (whey isolate or lean animal source)
  - 40-60g complex carbohydrates (oats, rice, potatoes)
  - 5-10g healthy fats
  - 200-300mg caffeine (if tolerated), 30-45 minutes pre-workout

- **Intra-Workout**:
  - 5-10g EAAs or 20-30g whey isolate
  - 20-30g fast-digesting carbs (highly branched cyclic dextrin or dextrose)
  - Electrolytes for optimal hydration

- **Post-Workout (within 30-45 minutes)**:
  - 30-40g fast-digesting protein (whey isolate)
  - 60-80g high-glycemic carbohydrates
  - Consider adding 5g creatine monohydrate

## Recovery Notes

- This workout heavily stresses the shoulder joint; ensure proper warm-up and technique
- Allow 48-72 hours before directly training chest, shoulders, or triceps again
- Focus on proper sleep (7-9 hours) to maximize recovery and growth hormone release
- Implement self-myofascial release (foam rolling) for chest, shoulders, and triceps
- Consider using joint support supplements if performing this program long-term (glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM)
- Ensure proper hydration, aiming for 3-4 liters of water daily
- Pay special attention to shoulder health with additional rotator cuff prehabilitation if needed
