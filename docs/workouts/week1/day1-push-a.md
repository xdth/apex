## Cool Down

## Progressive Overload Strategy
- **Week 1**: Focus on form and muscle engagement
- **Week 2**: Increase weight by 5-10% if form is solid
- **Week 3**: Implement advanced techniques fully
- **Week 4**: Push intensity with advanced techniques

## Notes
- If shoulder discomfort occurs during bench press, adjust grip width
- For tricep extensions, use lighter weight to ensure proper technique
- Rate your performance after the workout on a scale of 1-10
- Record all weights and actual reps performed in your [workout log](../../logs/push-a-log.md)

## Exercise Substitutions
If equipment is limited, these are acceptable substitutions:
- Bench Press → Floor Press or Push-Ups
- Military Press → Seated Dumbbell Press
- Overhead Triceps Extension → Dumbbell Triceps Extensions
