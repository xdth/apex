## Exercise Descriptions

### Dumbbell Flyes

**Target Muscles**: Chest (primary), Shoulders (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Lie back on a flat bench holding two dumbbells directly above your chest with palms facing each other
2. Lower the dumbbells in an arc motion until you feel a stretch across your chest
3. Maintain a slight bend in the elbows throughout the movement
4. Use the pectoral muscles to bring the dumbbells back together in an arc motion
5. Execute with a 2:1:2 tempo (2s down, 1s hold, 2s up)

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows throughout the movement
- Focus on feeling the stretch across the chest at the bottom
- Visualize hugging a barrel during the concentric phase
- Keep the shoulder blades retracted and stable

**Common Errors**:
- Flattening the back by not maintaining scapular retraction
- Using too much weight and turning the movement into a press
- Allowing the elbows to straighten completely

### Bench Press

**Target Muscles**: Chest (primary), Shoulders and Triceps (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Lie on a flat bench with feet firmly planted on the floor
2. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width
3. Unrack the bar and position it above the mid-chest
4. Lower the bar with control to mid-chest
5. Press the bar back up to the starting position by pushing yourself away from the bar

**Key Technical Points**:
- Maintain a natural arch in the lower back
- Drive through the feet to create a stable platform
- Keep the wrists straight and elbows tucked at approximately 45-degree angles
- Control the eccentric (lowering) phase for 2 seconds

**Common Errors**:
- Bouncing the bar off the chest
- Flaring the elbows excessively (increases shoulder stress)
- Lifting the hips off the bench
- Inconsistent bar path

### Incline Dumbbell Press

**Target Muscles**: Upper Chest (primary), Shoulders and Triceps (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Set an adjustable bench to 45 degrees
2. Sit with back firmly against the pad, feet flat on the floor
3. Hold dumbbells just outside shoulder width at shoulder level
4. Press the dumbbells up and slightly inward until arms are extended
5. Lower with control back to the starting position

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep the weights aligned with the mid-chest throughout the movement
- Maintain shoulder blade retraction and depression
- Achieve a full stretch at the bottom without excessive depth
- For the double rest-pause on the last set: reach failure, rest 15 seconds, continue to failure again, rest 15 seconds, final push to failure

**Common Errors**:
- Setting the bench too steep (shifts focus to shoulders)
- Losing back contact with the bench
- Excessive internal rotation at the top (shoulder stress)

### Military Press

**Target Muscles**: Shoulders (primary), Triceps (secondary)

**Execution**:
1. Start with the barbell at shoulder height, hands slightly wider than shoulders
2. Feet shoulder-width apart, core braced
3. Press the bar overhead until arms are fully extended
4. Lower the bar with control back to shoulder level
5. For the last set: perform partial reps in the top range after reaching failure

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep the core tight and avoid excessive arching of the lower back
- Press the bar slightly backward to allow it to clear the face
- Achieve full lockout at the top without forcing the shoulders into impingement
- Keep the elbows directly under the wrists throughout the movement

**Common Errors**:
- Leaning back excessively to compensate for limited shoulder mobility
- Flaring the elbows too far out to the sides
- Allowing the bar path to drift forward

### Dumbbell Lateral Raise

**Target Muscles**: Middle Deltoids (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, dumbbells at your sides
2. Keep a slight bend in the elbows
3. Raise the dumbbells out to the sides until slightly above shoulder level
4. Control the descent back to the starting position
5. Superset immediately with Overhead Triceps Extension

**Key Technical Points**:
- Initiate the movement with the lateral deltoid, not the traps
- Keep the motion strictly lateral (not front or back)
- Thumb slightly higher than pinky (slight internal rotation) to better target middle delts
- A slight forward lean (5-10°) can enhance middle deltoid activation

**Common Errors**:
- Using momentum and swinging the weights
- Shrugging the shoulders during the lift
- Raising the dumbbells too high (above shoulder level)

### Overhead Triceps Extension

**Target Muscles**: Triceps (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Stand or sit with feet shoulder-width apart
2. Hold an EZ bar with a narrow grip, arms extended overhead
3. Lower the bar behind your head by bending at the elbows
4. Extend the elbows to return to the starting position
5. Use a 3:1:3 tempo (3s lowering, 1s pause, 3s lifting)

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep the upper arms close to the head and stationary
- Fully extend the triceps at the top of the movement
- Control the eccentric phase especially with the prescribed tempo
- Keep the core tight to prevent excessive arching

**Common Errors**:
- Moving the elbows (they should remain pointing upward)
- Using too much weight and compromising form
- Incomplete range of motion

### Triceps Kickbacks

**Target Muscles**: Triceps (primary)

**Execution**:
1. Bend at the hips to about 45° with a neutral spine, holding dumbbells
2. Bring the upper arms parallel to the floor and close to the torso
3. Extend the elbows to push the weights back and up
4. Hold the contracted position for 1 second
5. Return to the starting position with control

**Key Technical Points**:
- Keep the upper arms completely stationary throughout the movement
- Achieve a complete contraction by fully extending the elbows
- Hold the peak contraction for 1 second to maximize tension
- Control the eccentric phase for optimal triceps development

**Common Errors**:
- Allowing the upper arms to drop
- Using momentum to swing the weights
- Not achieving full extension at the top

## Advanced Techniques Used

### Pre-Exhaustion

The workout begins with an isolation movement (Dumbbell Flyes) before moving to compound movements. This pre-exhausts the chest muscles, forcing them to work harder during the compound exercises that follow, potentially creating greater growth stimulus. This technique helps improve the mind-muscle connection and ensures the target muscles reach deeper fatigue.

### Double Rest-Pause

Applied to the last set of Incline Dumbbell Press. After reaching failure, rest for 15 seconds, then continue to failure again. Rest another 15 seconds and perform a final push to failure. This technique extends a set beyond normal failure, recruiting more muscle fibers and creating significant metabolic stress, a key driver of hypertrophy.

### Reduced Rest Periods

The bench press is performed with only 90-second rest periods between sets, rather than the standard 2-3 minutes for heavy compound movements. This increases metabolic stress and growth hormone production, creating a more conducive environment for hypertrophy.

### Partial Reps

Applied to the last set of Military Press. After reaching failure with full-range reps, continue with partial repetitions in the top range of motion. This allows you to continue stimulating the muscle after full-range failure has occurred, increasing total training volume and mechanical tension.

## Workout Progression

- **Week 1-2**: Focus on establishing solid form and mind-muscle connection. Use weights that allow you to reach the higher end of the rep ranges (10 reps for 8-10, 15 reps for 12-15).

- **Week 3-4**: Increase weights by 5-10% on compound movements and 2.5-5% on isolation exercises. Aim for the mid-range of the prescribed rep counts.

- **Week 5-6**: Further increase weights to reach the lower end of the rep ranges, but maintain perfect form. Fully implement all prescribed advanced techniques with proper execution.

## Nutrition Considerations

- **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before)**:
  - 25-40g protein (whey isolate or lean animal source)
  - 40-60g complex carbohydrates (oats, rice, potatoes)
  - Small amount of healthy fats (5-10g)
  - Caffeine (200-300mg) if tolerated, 30-45 minutes pre-workout

- **Intra-Workout**:
  - 5-10g EAAs or 20-30g whey isolate
  - 20-30g fast-digesting carbs (highly branched cyclic dextrin or dextrose)
  - Adequate hydration with electrolytes

- **Post-Workout (within 30-45 minutes)**:
  - 30-40g fast-digesting protein (whey isolate)
  - 60-80g high-glycemic carbohydrates

## Recovery Notes

- Ensure at least 48 hours before training chest or shoulders again
- Foam roll the pectorals, anterior deltoids, and triceps
- Apply contrast therapy (hot/cold) if experiencing significant muscle soreness
- Focus on quality sleep (7-9 hours) to maximize recovery and growth hormone release
- Consider selective supplementation: 3-5g creatine daily, 2-3g omega-3s, 1.5-3g L-carnitine L-tartrate
