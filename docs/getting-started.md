# Getting Started with APEX

Welcome to the APEX (Advanced Physique Enhancement Program)! This guide will help you implement this science-based hypertrophy program effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the APEX program, ensure you have:

1. **Consulted a healthcare professional** to ensure you're ready for an intensive training program
2. **Access to the required equipment**:
   - Olympic barbell
   - Shorter barbell
   - Adjustable dumbbells
   - EZ bar
   - Incline bench with barbell rack
3. **Basic understanding of proper exercise form**
4. **At least 6-12 months of consistent training experience**

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Assess Your Starting Point

Before beginning, record:
- Current body measurements
- Starting strength levels on key lifts
- Progress photos (optional)

### Step 2: Review the Program Structure

Familiarize yourself with the [program structure](/docs/program-overview):
- 6-day PPL split (Push/Pull/Legs)
- Advanced hypertrophy techniques
- Recovery protocols

### Step 3: Set Up Your Training Schedule

Decide when you'll train each day:
- Schedule 6 training sessions per week
- Place your rest day strategically (typically after day 3 or day 6)
- Allocate 45-75 minutes per session

### Step 4: Begin with Week 1

Start with the Week 1 workouts:
- [Day 1: Push Workout A](/docs/workouts/week1/day1-push-a)
- Day 2: Pull Workout A
- Day 3: Legs Workout A
- Day 4: Push Workout B
- Day 5: Pull Workout B
- Day 6: Legs Workout B

### Step 5: Track Your Progress

Use the provided [tracking tools](/docs/tracking/templates) to monitor:
- Weight used for each exercise
- Sets and reps completed
- Rating of perceived exertion (RPE)
- Recovery quality

## Implementation Timeline

For best results, follow this progressive implementation:

**Weeks 1-2:**
- Focus on mastering proper exercise technique
- Begin at 70-80% of your usual working weights
- Learn the movement patterns and exercise order

**Weeks 3-4:**
- Increase weights to your normal working range
- Begin implementing basic intensification techniques
- Start following the prescribed rest periods closely

**Weeks 5-6:**
- Implement all advanced techniques as prescribed
- Push intensity while maintaining proper form
- Follow the nutrition guidelines closely

**Weeks 7-8:**
- Full implementation of all program components
- Focus on progressive overload
- Use autoregulation to manage fatigue

## Warning Signs

Be alert to these warning signs of overtraining:
- Persistent joint pain (different from muscle soreness)
- Decreased performance across multiple sessions
- Disrupted sleep patterns
- Unusual fatigue or decreased motivation

If you experience these symptoms, consider taking an extra rest day or implementing a deload week.

## Next Steps

Once you're ready to begin:
1. Review the [Exercise Library](/docs/exercise-library) for proper form guidance
2. Set up your [Nutrition Plan](/docs/nutrition-guide) to support muscle growth
3. Begin with [Week 1, Day 1: Push Workout A](/docs/workouts/week1/day1-push-a)

Remember to consult with qualified fitness and healthcare professionals before beginning this or any exercise program.
