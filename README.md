## üî• Overview

APEX (Advanced Physique Enhancement Program) is a scientifically-designed, hypertrophy-focused training program implementing cutting-edge techniques for maximum muscle growth. This program utilizes a 6-day Push/Pull/Legs split with carefully calibrated volume, intensity, and advanced training methodologies.

### Program Highlights

- **Training Split**: Push/Pull/Legs performed twice weekly
- **Frequency**: Each muscle group trained 2x per week with varied stimuli
- **Rest Days**: 1 day (flexible placement)
- **Focus**: Maximum hypertrophy with advanced techniques
- **Available Equipment**: Olympic barbell, shorter barbell, adjustable dumbbells, EZ bar, incline bench

## üìã Program Structure

APEX follows a 6-day Push/Pull/Legs structure:

| Day | Focus | Primary Muscle Groups |
|-----|-------|----------------------|
| 1 | Push A | Chest, Shoulders, Triceps |
| 2 | Pull A | Back, Biceps |
| 3 | Legs A | Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves |
| 4 | Push B | Chest, Shoulders, Triceps (different angles/exercises) |
| 5 | Pull B | Back, Biceps (different angles/exercises) |
| 6 | Legs B | Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves (different angles/exercises) |
| 7 | Rest | Active recovery, mobility work |

### Advanced Techniques

The program implements research-backed hypertrophy techniques:

- **Mechanical Drop Sets**: Continue with an easier variation after reaching failure
- **Double Rest-Pause**: Rest briefly after failure, continue to second failure, rest again, final push
- **Tempo Manipulation**: Strategic control of eccentric, isometric, and concentric phases
- **Partial Repetitions**: Additional partial range of motion reps after reaching failure
- **Pre-Exhaustion**: Isolation exercise immediately before a compound movement for target muscle
