# APEX: Advanced Physique Enhancement Program

Welcome to APEX, a comprehensive hypertrophy-focused training system designed to maximize muscle growth through evidence-based training techniques and principles.

## Program Highlights

- **6-Day Push/Pull/Legs Split**: Optimized training frequency with each muscle group trained twice weekly
- **Advanced Hypertrophy Techniques**: Mechanical drop sets, rest-pause training, and tempo manipulation
- **Scientifically-Backed Principles**: Based on the latest research in resistance training and muscle hypertrophy
- **Complete System**: Includes training, nutrition, recovery, and progress tracking components

## Getting Started

This program is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to maximize hypertrophy (muscle growth). To begin:

1. [**Read the Program Overview**](/apex/docs/program-overview/) to understand the principles and methodology
2. [**Check Required Equipment**](/apex/docs/equipment/) to ensure you have access to the necessary tools
3. [**Review the Workout Structure**](/apex/docs/workouts/) to understand the training split
4. [**Start with Week 1**](/apex/docs/workouts/week1/) and follow the program as prescribed

## Program Philosophy

APEX is built on three core pillars:

1. **Scientific Foundation**: All program elements are based on peer-reviewed research and evidence-based practices
2. **Progressive Overload**: Systematic increases in training stimulus to drive continuous adaptation
3. **Recovery Optimization**: Strategic recovery protocols to maximize supercompensation and prevent burnout

The program incorporates advanced hypertrophy techniques including mechanical drop sets, rest-pause training, tempo manipulation, and pre-exhaustion methods to maximize muscle fiber recruitment and metabolic stress.
